# Using the Exercise Branches and Functions, create a simple puzzle game which starts with
# asking user a question. For every question, you should either give user the option to select from
# or let user enter the answer. For each user answer, your game should take the next step
# accordingly using conditions.
# 1. Your game should ask user for input at least five â€‹times
# 2. Your code should have functions (basically for everything)



#this is the complete word, these are the correct letters that haven't been guessed yet


#the entire alphabet, for guessing purposes
