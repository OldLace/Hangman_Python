# Using the Exercise Branches and Functions, create a simple puzzle game which starts with
# asking user a question. For every question, you should either give user the option to select from
# or let user enter the answer. For each user answer, your game should take the next step
# accordingly using conditions.
# 1. Your game should ask user for input at least five â€‹times
# 2. Your code should have functions (basically for everything)

answer_letters = ['B','L','U','E']

possible_choices = ['A','B','C','D','E','F','G','H','I','J','K','L','M','N','N','O','O'

    choice = input('Pick a letter: ')
